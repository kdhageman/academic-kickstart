I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at the Wireless Communication Section at the Aalborg University, Denmark.
The PhD project focuses on understanding the behaviour of phishers and towards the detection phishing domains early in their lifecycle.
My research interests include network security, the analysis of the Internet at large and besides that I have a curiosity for machine learning.

In addition, I have been involved in the development of the (soon to be) open-source [Haaukins](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins) platform, a virtualization platform used for the education of information security.
