abstract = "The education of IT security basics can be a frustrating and demotivating process for inexperienced students. In order to improve upon this process, we have developed a novel virtu- alization platform, Haaukins. The platform gives participants access to an isolated, individualized lab of vulnerable virtual instances to be exploited. The development of the platform is motivated by the unique use case of short classroom workshops for an audience with little prior knowledge and experience. This paper describes the overall design and the realisation of four primary design goals of the platform: full automation, transparency of participant behaviour, high accessibility and realism. The creation, configuration and orchestration of labs and their individual components is fully automated. Optionally, the behaviour of participants can be monitored for the purpose of improving the material hosted on the platform. Labs are highly accessible through a web application, requiring no additional software to be installed by participants. Lastly, the platform is a realistic representation of real insecure computer networks. To support other organisations to run similar workshops, the platform has been made available open source."
